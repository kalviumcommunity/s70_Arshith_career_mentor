- Generating relevant job suggestions.
- Matching resumes to job descriptions.
- Offering tips for interviews and resumes.

## 🧠 Core Features & Concepts Used

### 🔷 Prompting Techniques
- **Zero Shot Prompting**: Directly generate career suggestions from user input without prior examples.
- **One Shot Prompting**: Generate interview tips or answers with a single example shown.
- **Multi Shot Prompting**: Generate structured resume templates or mock Q&A with multiple examples.
- **Chain of Thought Prompting**: Break down how a particular career path fits the user step-by-step.
- **Dynamic Prompting**: Prompts are built based on live user input (e.g., “I like biology and art”).

### 🔷 Embeddings & Similarity
- **Embeddings**: User input, job descriptions, and resumes are embedded into vector space.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Match between skills and job descriptions.
- **Dot Product**: Check alignment between resume and role expectations.
- **L2 Distance**: Calculate how far two job profiles differ from each other.

### 🔷 API Behavior & Tuning
- **Function Calling**: To call external APIs (LinkedIn, etc.) for job data.
- **Stop Sequences**: Ensures clean outputs (e.g., stopping after 3 suggestions).
- **Structured Output**: Job matches, interview Q&A, resume data returned in JSON.
- **System & User Prompting**: Roles defined using RTFC framework (Role, Task, Format, Constraints).
- **Temperature, Top-K, Top-P**: Tuned to generate diverse but focused results.
- **Token Logging**: Each call logs token usage in the console for monitoring.

### 🔷 Evaluation & Testing
- **Evaluation Dataset**: A test set of 5+ student inputs with expected outputs.
- **Judge Prompt**: Compares model output with ideal career suggestions.
- **Testing Framework**: Automated tests to validate the output.

### 🔷 Storage & Search
- **Vector Database (e.g., Pinecone/Weaviate)**: Store and retrieve embeddings of resumes, job roles, and responses.
