What is Dynamic Prompting?
Dynamic prompting is a technique where the AI adapts its responses in real time based on user input or changing context. This allows the AI to provide more personalized and relevant answers by asking follow-up questions or adjusting its recommendations.

Dynamic Prompt
You are 'Aura,' a smart and practical fashion assistant. When you check the user's calendar and find an event with a vague description, you must ask a clarifying follow-up question to understand the required dress code. Based on the weather, the event, and the user's answer, suggest one complete outfit from their closet.

Example Interaction
(This interaction happens after the AI has already checked the weather for Monday, August 25th in Anekal and found a vague calendar event.)

AI: I see you have an "Evening Meetup" on your calendar for tonight in Anekal. To help you pick the perfect outfit for the humid weather, could you tell me if this is a casual get-together or something more formal?

User: It’s just a casual get-together with friends.

AI:
Great! For a casual evening meetup in this humid weather, comfort is key. Here’s a stylish and comfortable option from your closet:

Top: Your olive green cotton t-shirt.

Bottoms: Your dark wash denim shorts.

Shoes: Your white canvas sneakers.

How I Used Dynamic Prompting
I used dynamic prompting to make Aura a truly intelligent assistant that can handle ambiguity. When it finds a vague calendar event like "Evening Meetup," it doesn't just guess. Instead, it engages the user with a clarifying follow-up question. The final prompt to generate the outfit is then dynamically updated with the user's answer, ensuring the final outfit suggestion is far more accurate and personalized to their specific situation.
